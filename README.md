# CouchPlay

Split-screen gaming manager for Linux, designed for KDE Plasma and Gamescope. CouchPlay enables multi-seat gaming sessions on a single PC by managing input device assignment, multiple Gamescope instances, and audio routing.

## Features

- 🎮 **Input Isolation**: Assign specific gamepads/keyboards to specific player instances.
- 🖥️ **Multi-Instance**: Run multiple games simultaneously using Gamescope nested compositors.
- 🔊 **Audio Routing**: Route game audio to specific outputs (via PipeWire).
- 👤 **User Management**: Automatically manages temporary user accounts for isolated save data.
- 🐧 **Atomic-Ready**: Designed for immutable distributions like Bazzite and Fedora Silverblue.
